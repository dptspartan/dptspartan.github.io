                                <h1>Draw On VR</h1>
                                <p>This wads a project I did for a company based in USA called ClarityTec. The idea was to use VR 
                                    to let user draw a prompt which will them be recorded. This was of the tricky projects ive done as the
                                    implementation wasn't really as simple as it seems. there wasn't much helpful documentation out there.
                                    So i pretty much had to figure out on my own. Ultimately i did provide a working solution however the project
                                    was never completed by me as per there requirement. The issue ws that i was unable to manage my time. I not only
                                    messed up this Project but had bad grades that semester. Moving on from this im learning and slowly
                                    improving in life. With all the mess-up i learned a lot about what to do and what no to.
                                    Also realized my own limits along the way so in the end this project did bring a lot o change to me
                                    and im even more ready to work on many more projects to come.
